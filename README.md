# Luke 24 Modern-Scribe Corpus (Helsinki pilot)

The first **Koine Greek** corpus of *modern* hand-copied manuscripts, produced to
supply **ground-truth data** for computational stemmatology. Eight students and
staff of the Theology Department at the University of Helsinki iteratively copied
an extract of the Gospel of Luke taken from the Bezae (**24:1–28**, the road to Emmaus).

As the true genealogy of the copies is known *by construction*, our dataset can be used
to score automatic stemma-reconstruction methods.

> This dataset was produced as part of the **Experimenting the Rise of Early Christianity** project
(University of Helsinki · Umeå University · Sorbonne Université).

## The known ("gold") stemma

Witnesses are named according to `<parent><generation-rank>`.

## Formatting choices

Each witness is de-hyphenated, stripped of editorial markers (`?`, `~`, `·`,
marginal numbers), lower-cased and accent-folded. Witnesses are collated against
a base witness (`11`, the fullest clean copy) by Needleman–Wunsch alignment on
token sequences, with token equality defined at a *normalized* level that folds
the Koine vowel-interchange sets (itacism), movable-nu, and nomina
sacra.
As scribes copied a contiguous **prefix** and stopped when time
ran out, trailing absence is recorded as *lacuna* (not-copied), not omission and the only
**comparable core** ipresent in all eight witnesses is Luke 24:1–10a,
130 tokens, as the rest of the pericope presents as a *lacuna* in other manuscripts.
Each non-base reading is classified into three tiers —
**orthographic/phonological**, **mechanical/palaeographic**, and
**structural/textual** — and pairwise distances feed a neighbour-joining tree
compared to the design stemma with the Robinson–Foulds metric.
